you can do what's more important: **define terminology**.

  ]

`basePath` | `glossary` | Path to render the glossary page

## Customizing

The glossary itself can be customized in a few ways. You can change
the description text, the layout, and even the theme.

### Description

You can optionally include a description under the glossary title
that can introduce/describe the glossary that will follow below.
You can achieve this by shadowing the `description.mdx` file:

`src/gatsby-theme-glossary/description.mdx`
```md
## Hey!

This is a custom description of my glossary.
```

### Layout

`gatsby-theme-glossary` doesn't use a layout because it's intended
that you shadow the layout component with your own so that it's properly
embedded in your site.

```js
// src/gatsby-theme-glossary/components/layout.js
export { default } from '../../components/layout'
```

### Theme

This theme uses Theme UI so you can read about how to customize
the theme in [the official docs](https://theme-ui.com/gatsby-plugin#customizing-the-theme).
